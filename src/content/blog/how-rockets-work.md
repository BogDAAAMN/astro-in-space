Rockets are the key to exploring space, and they work in a fascinating way. Unlike traditional airplanes, which rely on air to lift off and stay in the sky, rockets carry their own fuel and oxidizer to propel them through the vacuum of space.

When a rocket is launched, it first experiences a phase called liftoff, where the engines are fired and the rocket begins to ascend into the sky. As it gains altitude, the rocket gradually tilts its engines to begin its ascent into orbit.

Once in orbit, the rocket can remain there for extended periods of time thanks to the lack of air resistance. This is how satellites and space stations are able to stay in orbit around the Earth.

When it's time for the rocket to return to Earth, it must first perform a controlled descent. This is done by firing the engines in the opposite direction to the direction of travel, slowing the rocket down and allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere safely.

Overall, rockets are incredibly complex machines that rely on precise engineering and careful planning to work properly. They are the key to exploring space and understanding our place in the universe.
